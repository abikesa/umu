# Umu

- [Ms. Umu's](https://abikesa.github.io/samaltman/) isn't a promise, its her tragically beautiful story of loss, recovery, ditto three times over from blood relative, to spouse, and her legal carrier (failure to pass the bar)
- From exposure to 19th and 17ths harmonics in childhood; then to the 11th and 13th in early marriage (at first sight); and, to the "release" in form of her two sons (triad, 7th, and 9th)
- But moving forward: securing comfort for her sons & ensuring they never go beyond the triad; and then identifying her story as that of the girl child and ultimately feminism?

Your perspective touches on a fascinating and deeply philosophical view of beauty and engagement. It aligns with the idea that mystery and the unknown hold a particular allure that fully comprehensible entities lack. This concept isn't new; it echoes thoughts from various philosophical and artistic traditions that suggest true beauty lies in complexity, subtlety, and the layers that [unravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkkMs-UZpbU) over time.

In a way, what you're describing is the beauty of the ineffable—things that cannot be fully expressed or understood immediately, if at all. This notion can be seen in the works of Romantic poets like Keats, who famously wrote of "negative capability," or the ability to accept uncertainty and mystery without the irritable reaching after fact and reason. Similarly, in the visual arts, abstract expressionists valued the emotional impact and interpretations their works could inspire over any definitive meaning.

Your stance also brings to mind the aesthetic and intellectual pleasure derived from the process of discovery and the journey toward understanding. It suggests that beauty, in its most engaging form, invites us to `explore`, question, and reflect rather than to simply `observe` and `comprehend`. This engagement is not just aesthetic but deeply cognitive, intertwining with our natural curiosity and desire for intellectual challenge.

However, while the allure of the incomprehensible is undeniable, it's worth considering that there's also beauty in clarity and simplicity. Sometimes, the elegance of a concept or an object lies in its straightforwardness, its ability to be immediately grasped. This doesn't necessarily detract from its depth but rather presents a different kind of beauty—one that resides in purity, order, and transparency. Think of the architectural principles of Le Corbusier or the Zen gardens of Japan, where the beauty is palpable yet fully comprehensible in its serene simplicity. Alternatively, think "Casablanca" as simple linear narrative of Nazi's (tameth Europe), Europeans (whineth aloud), Americas (hideth Faraway). Everything else is tiny detail.

In essence, beauty is multifaceted and subjective. The [seduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction) of the incomprehensible you describe speaks to a deep and enriching form of engagement with the world—a pursuit of endless discovery and the joy of constantly expanding our horizons. However, the simplicity and clarity of understanding offer their own unique pleasures and insights, suggesting that perhaps the most profound beauty lies in balancing these contrasting experiences.

But lets be clear, its true beauty that you'll wish to hit "repeat" on since there's little chance for full comprehension on first take. In fact, it only gets deeper as you go from 1st to, 3rd, 5th, 7th (b and bb). And then to 11th (somewhat #) and 13th, but ultimately 17th (Phrygian b2, Neapolitan) and 19th (b3, #9). The permutations and combinations that come fourth from these 10 frequencies, and the addition of a 4th and 7th (both diatonic), to make the 12 notes of the chromatic, invite theme and variation that are of such distinct qualities that no one can tire! Remember: be suspicious of any work of art that isn't seductive enough over 33 variations (like the Golderg's)

# Archetype

- `la promesse` du bonheur
- unravel over time

# Tayebwa

- Simeon doesn't find Tayebwa's success "beautiful"
   - While there is a mystery to his initial financial success, one finds that it was opportunism rather than growth
   - And its that opportunism that's followed through to the realm of politics
   - One then asks: can't this "unravelling" be considered beautiful? Perhaps as beautiful as Rebecca, Jacob, and Laban!

Critiquing the notion of "love at first sight" through the lens provided, particularly with the inclusion of Stendhal's assertion that beauty is but the promise of happiness, presents a rich tapestry for discussion. The analogy to Greek mythology and music theory provides an intricate framework to explore the concept more deeply.

First, let's consider Stendhal's perspective: "La beauté n'est que la promesse du bonheur" translates to "beauty is but the promise of happiness." This idea suggests that the immediate attraction one feels at "first sight" is not love itself but an anticipation or promise of the joy and fulfillment that love could potentially bring. This is a critical distinction, as it moves away from the superficiality often associated with "love at first sight" to hint at something deeper, albeit initially sparked by aesthetic appreciation.

In terms of unraveling over time, much like the "unfolding" of a character in a story such as Rick in "Casablanca," love is something that develops and deepens with time, experience, and understanding. The initial aesthetic attraction (Morpheus) may be the root, but true love involves cognitive engagement (Hades), exploration (Cosmogonia), skillful navigation of relationship dynamics (Dionysus), emotional and intellectual harmonics (Prometheus), and ultimately growth and expression (Athena). 

The notion of "love at first sight" often neglects these deeper, more complex stages of love. It focuses instead on the immediate and often superficial aesthetic appeal, failing to account for the richness and depth that come with truly knowing and understanding another person. This view aligns with the more nuanced interpretation of love as an evolving, growing entity rather than a static, immediate phenomenon.

Rick's journey in "Casablanca" from a mysterious figure to someone whose depth and capacity for love and sacrifice are slowly revealed mirrors the process of discovering the true nature of love. It's not the immediate allure that defines his character but the layers that are revealed over time, through interaction, conflict, and ultimately, the choices he makes out of love.

Drawing on the musical analogy, just as a melody or harmony unfolds and reveals its complexity and beauty over time, so does love. The initial "pentatonic" simplicity of attraction might evolve into a "diatonic" phase of getting to know each other, followed by the "chromatic" complexities and nuances of a shared life, with its dissonances and resolutions. 

Thus, critiquing "love at first sight" through this multifaceted lens underscores the limitation of basing a concept as profound as love on the immediate and superficial. True love, much like the understanding and appreciation of beauty or the unfolding of a compelling narrative, requires time, engagement, and a willingness to explore and embrace complexity and growth.
