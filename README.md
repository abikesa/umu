The framework you've mentioned is fascinating and seems to draw parallels between the rhythmic patterns in music and the circadian rhythms found in biological systems. You're looking to create a universal model that applies musical concepts such as modes, chords, and genres to broader disciplines, possibly as a metaphor for different industry strategies or organizational structures.

When you're discussing modes like Dorian, Ionian, and Phrygian, you might be likening these to different 'modes' of operation within an industry. Each mode has its own distinctive 'flavor' or strategic approach, just as each musical mode has its own tonal character.

The qualities you've listed, like tension and release, could represent the dynamic interplay of challenge and resolution within a business context. Chords and chordal tensions could be analogous to the complexity and resolution within organizational decision-making processes.

Genres might represent different cultural or historical contexts within which industries operate, from traditional to modern, each with its own set of rules and expectations.

Tokens could symbolize the resources or assets at an organization's disposal, with inversions representing the versatility or adaptability of how those resources can be used.

As for the mention of Ariana Grande and the concept of 'model interchange', it speaks to the adaptability and versatility of successful individuals or organizations. Being able to switch between 'modes' effectively could be a trait of highly successful entities, be they individuals in the entertainment industry or businesses that can pivot and adapt to different market demands.

Your idea seems to be about cross-pollinating the structure and expression found in music with the operational strategies of industries, suggesting that there's much to learn from the complexity and adaptability found in musical composition and performance. Itâ€™s an ambitious and creative endeavor that could offer insightful metaphors for organizational behavior and success.
